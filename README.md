# pqc-mobile-client

Post-Quantum TLS HTTPS client for mobile apps — **iOS 15.1+** and **Android API 29+**. Single Rust core built on `rustls` + `rustls-post-quantum` + `aws-lc-rs` + `reqwest`, exposed to Kotlin and Swift via UniFFI.

Designed for any mobile app — **native iOS (Swift/Obj-C), native Android (Kotlin/Java), or React Native** — that needs to negotiate `X25519MLKEM768` against PQC-enabled servers (Akamai, Cloudflare, AWS) on OS versions that don't have native PQC TLS yet.

> Companion design docs: [`PQC_MOBILE_ANALYSIS.md`](../commshub/PQC_MOBILE_ANALYSIS.md), [`PQC_RN_IMPLEMENTATION.md`](../commshub/PQC_RN_IMPLEMENTATION.md).

## Why this exists

Akamai's edge has hybrid PQC TLS (`X25519MLKEM768`, IANA codepoint `0x11EC`) enabled. iOS 26+ and Chrome already negotiate it by default, but:

- **iOS 15.1–18:** no native PQC TLS. `URLSession`'s TLS engine is closed; ATS doesn't expose group selection.
- **Android API 29+:** system Conscrypt does not advertise `X25519MLKEM768` by default on any shipped Android release (incl. Android 17). Google has not committed to a default-on date.
- **Cronet** ships PQC via Chrome's BoringSSL, but the only Maven-published artifact that includes PQC requires Google Play Services (no GMS → no PQC). The `cronet-embedded` Maven artifact is frozen at Chromium 113 (pre-PQC).

This crate provides a **unified, single-codebase, FIPS-validated** alternative that works on every supported OS version and on every Android device regardless of GMS availability.

## Who consumes this

| Consumer | Pattern | Doc |
|---|---|---|
| Native Android app (Kotlin/Java) using OkHttp / Retrofit / Ktor | Custom `Interceptor` that delegates to `PqcHttpClient` | [`android/README.md`](android/README.md) §3 |
| Native Android app using `HttpURLConnection` or no framework | Call `PqcHttpClient` directly from Kotlin/Java | [`android/README.md`](android/README.md) §6 |
| React Native Android app | Same `Interceptor` installed via `OkHttpClientProvider.setOkHttpClientFactory` | [`android/README.md`](android/README.md) §5 |
| Native iOS app using `URLSession` | Register `PqcURLProtocol` on the session config | [`ios/README.md`](ios/README.md) §3 |
| Native iOS app using a custom HTTP client (AsyncHTTPClient, etc.) | Call `PqcHttpClient` directly from Swift/Obj-C | [`ios/README.md`](ios/README.md) §5 |
| React Native iOS app | `PqcURLProtocol` registered via `RCTSetCustomNSURLSessionConfigurationProvider` | [`ios/README.md`](ios/README.md) §6 |

The Rust core, Kotlin bindings, and Swift bindings are **identical** across all six consumers. Only the integration glue at the call site differs.

## Quick start

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh                 # one-time: rust targets, cargo-ndk, uniffi-bindgen
cargo test -- --nocapture          # sanity-test against pq.cloudflareresearch.com
./scripts/build-android.sh         # cross-compile all Android ABIs + Kotlin bindings
./scripts/build-ios.sh             # build XCFramework + Swift bindings
```

## What this covers

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 (via reqwest + hyper) | ✅ |
| HTTP/3 / QUIC | ⏳ Opt-in via cargo feature, not enabled by default |
| Hybrid PQC TLS (`X25519MLKEM768`) | ✅ Default |
| Classical fallback (X25519, P-256) | ✅ Automatic |
| System trust store (iOS Keychain / Android KeyStore) | ✅ Via `rustls-platform-verifier` |
| Cert pinning (SPKI SHA-256) | ✅ Layered on top of platform verifier; empty pin list disables |
| Cookies | ✅ `reqwest` cookie store |
| gzip / brotli decompression | ✅ |
| Redirects | ✅ |
| Connection pooling | ✅ |
| Timeouts (connect / read / total) | ✅ |
| Cancellation | ✅ Via UniFFI async + tokio |
| All HTTP methods | ✅ GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS |
| Negotiated TLS group reporting on `HttpResponse` | ✅ Via instrumented `CryptoProvider` (see `src/kx_tracker.rs`) |
| Android GMS + non-GMS devices | ✅ |
| iOS 15.1 – 18 | ✅ |
| iOS 26+ | ✅ (skip via `#available` and let native URLSession negotiate PQC) |

## What this does NOT cover

- **WebViews** (`WKWebView` on iOS, system WebView on Android) — use system network stack, not interceptable.
- **iOS background URLSession** (resumable uploads while app is suspended) — OS daemon owns the socket.
- **RN `<Image>` / Fresco / SDWebImage / Glide** — own HTTP loaders. Acceptable for non-sensitive image CDN traffic.
- **RN iOS WebSocket (`SRWebSocket`)** — CFStream-based, not URLSession.
- **3rd-party native SDKs** (Firebase, Sentry, Razorpay, AppsFlyer, etc.) — bundle their own HTTP clients.
- **Streaming bodies > a few MB** — possible but needs ~300 LOC of FFI plumbing; not in MVP.

## Dependencies

| Crate | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `reqwest` | 0.12 | HTTP client (redirects, cookies, gzip, brotli, pooling, HTTP/2) |
| `rustls` | 0.23 | Pure-Rust TLS 1.3 stack |
| `rustls-post-quantum` | 0.2 | Adds `X25519MLKEM768` to default group list |
| `rustls-platform-verifier` | 0.5 | Defers cert validation to OS trust store |
| `aws-lc-rs` | 1.13 | FIPS 140-3 validated crypto provider (also used for SPKI SHA-256) |
| `x509-parser` | 0.16 | Extract SPKI bytes from server cert for pinning |
| `base64` | 0.22 | Decode user-supplied pin hashes |
| `tokio` | 1 | Async runtime |
| `uniffi` | 0.29 | Generates Kotlin + Swift bindings from `src/pqc.udl` |

## Status

**Baseline verified.** Crate compiles, all unit tests pass (11), and the smoke test against `pq.cloudflareresearch.com` returns `200` with `X25519MLKEM768` negotiated *and verified* (the smoke test now asserts on the actual negotiated group, not a hardcoded constant). Verified on Rust stable `1.95`, macOS host. Integration recipes documented for native and React Native on both platforms; cross-compile scripts ready but not yet exercised in CI.

Outstanding items:
- CI workflows for cross-compile validation.
- Sample RN app exercising the integration end-to-end.
